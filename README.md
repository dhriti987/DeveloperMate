# DevelopersMate

## Problem
Whenever I want to build a Project it becomes very difficult for me to get a Project partner who has the skills which are required for the project. For Eg. Let's say I want to build a web app. As I know frontend technologies I will be responsible for building the frontend part of the app but I need someone who can help me with the backend aspects. This is a situation where this app becomes helpful. You can filter out developers according to their skills and choose a partner who is perfect for your next project.

## Tech stack
* **ReactJs** - Frontend 
* **Django** - Backend
* **Redux** - State Managment
* **React Router** - Internal Routing

## Features
* You can filter out developers according to their skills and find developers which best suit for you project.
* Apart from that, this app can also be used as a social media website.
* We are also building a chat system which will make communication much easier.

## Local Setup
